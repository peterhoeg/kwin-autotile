# autotile
Autotiling for KWin using heavy inspiration from [kwin-tiling-scripts](https://invent.kde.org/mart/kwin-tiling-scripts).

## contributing
Please do! I have very little time to maintain this script as much as it needs to be. There are many bugs that render it more-or-less unuseable (cut down to less, but still there).

I will try to be active on the Github for this project, to point out issues and such.

## building
Run `make` and then `make install`.

## license
MIT licensed, do whatever with credit given
