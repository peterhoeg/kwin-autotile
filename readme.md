# autotile
Autotiling for KWin using heavy inspiration from [kwin-tiling-scripts](https://invent.kde.org/mart/kwin-tiling-scripts).

## contributing
Please do! I have very little time to maintain this script as much as it needs to be. There are many bugs that render it more-or-less unuseable (cut down to less, but still there).

I will try to be active on the Github for this project, to point out issues and such.

## building
Run zip -r autotile.kwinscript autotile from outside this directory to build. Then install autotile.kwinscript. Opendesktop wouldn't let me verify my email, so I cannot upload the script to the KWin shop.
